1. Points per player. Each player gets 1 points when attacking an enemy player. [Code](https://github.com/Tornifrog-Interactive/Week11_Multiplayer/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/Points.cs)
2. Two teams match. The players are seperated into 2 teams, Red and Blue. Players from the same team cannot attack each other. [Code](https://github.com/Tornifrog-Interactive/Week11_Multiplayer/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/PlayerSpawner.cs)
3. The teams are based on the tag. [Code](https://github.com/Tornifrog-Interactive/Week11_Multiplayer/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/PlayerTag.cs)
